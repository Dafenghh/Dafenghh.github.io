# I Can't Accepty My Mediocrity

I ever had a big dream. 
When I participated in NOIP Junior, I dreamt to be selected as provincial team member and take part in NOI. But I failed in the baby step. I only scored 100 points in NOIP 2012 Junior with a total score of 400 points. I remember I was very frustrated on the day I was informed the result. When I entered high school, I found the Informatics teacher teaching so slowly that we were still learning loops in pascal before NOIP. Then I dropped out of OI. However, this decision is now proved to be the worst decision I have ever made.
I really admire those guys who achieve excellent result in NOI. They are so cool. It’s the long-lasted effort and 1000+ difficult problems solved to enable them enter the stage. But I have never paid such an effort.
I love math too. Taking part in CMO and even IMO is another big dream that I was looking forward to before I entered high school. I loved reading the book Mathematics Olympics Tutorials at that time. But I felt extremely difficult when I learned trigonometric functions in the book. It was so hard for me that I even couldn’t solve any problems in the attached practices. Later I dropout of mathematics contest too and start to live a common high school life.
Even though I gave up contests, I should have worked hard in college entrance examination subjects. But regrettably, I didn’t do it.
I struggled in depressed mood during 2nd year of high school. And my biggest drawback is procrastination. I couldn’t arrange my time properly. Hence, I wasted nearly the whole 2nd year. 
It’s so disappointing. I abandon my OI dream and also lost the chance to get into a better university.
I also dreamt to get into Hongkong University. But looking back now, these are simply a dream. My actions can not be commensurate with the big dreams.
